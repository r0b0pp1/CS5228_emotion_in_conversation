Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
